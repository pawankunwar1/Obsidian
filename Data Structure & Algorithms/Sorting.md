<h> Bubble Sort </h>
 -> In every step we are comparing adjacent elements.
 -> In first step or first pass through the array , large elements come at the end.
 -> In second step, the second large elements come at the 2nd from last index.
 -> And So On.
 -> Also known as sinking sort and exchange sort.

<p> Time Complexity </p>
-> As the size of array is growing , then the number of compares also growing.


Stable and Unstable Algorithms
-> Stable :- When the order is maintained for equal value  in sorted array  called stable.
-> Unstable :- If not unstable.
