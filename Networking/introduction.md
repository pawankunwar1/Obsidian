<p> Modem/ Router </p> 
-> Modem or Router allocate local ip address through <b> DHCP Protocol </b>
-> When there are multiple devices in the network and one device request for google.com , then the response should be given to particular devices whom it request is done by using <b> NAT (Network Access Translator) </b>
-> Modem / Router knows through NAT in which devices response should be given but there are many applications running on computer so we use <b> Port Number </b>
-> Ephermial Port

<h> Port Numbers </h>
-> From 0 to 1023 -> Reserved Ports.
-> From 1024 to 49152 -> Some specific applications like sql server , monodb etc
-> Remaining One -> we can use.


<h> OSI MODEL </h>
-> Open system interconnection model 
-> The idea is to develop a standard way to communicate two or more communicate.

7) Application Layer
6) Presentation Layer
5) Session Layer 
4)  Transport Layer
3) Network Layer
2) Data Link Layer
1) Physical Layer 

-> Every single layer have different protocols , devices being used.


<h> TCP/IP MODEL </h>
5) Application Layer
4) Transport Layer
3) Network Layer
2) Data Link Layer
1) Physical Layer 



-> HTTP protocol uses TCP protocol.

-> SSL(Secure Socket Layer)
-> TLS (Transport Layer Security)

-> TLS is upgraded version of SSL. There are also different version of TLS like 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 etc. They work in presentation layer of around 6.5 layer.
