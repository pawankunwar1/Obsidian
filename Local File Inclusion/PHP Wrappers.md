-> PHP Filter -> Used to access the local file system; this is case insensitive wrapper that provides the capability to apply filters to a stream at the time of opening file. This wrapper can be used to get content of a file preventing the server from executing it. For example, allowing an attacker to read the content of PHP files to get sources code to identify sensitive information such as credentials or other exploitable vulnerabilities. The wrapper can be used like `php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=FILE` where `FILE` is the file to retrieve. As a result of the usage of this execution, the content of the target file would be read, encoded to base64.

-> PHP ZIP -> The structure is `zip://filename_path#internal_filename` where `filename_path` is the path to the malicious file and `internal_filename` is the path where the malicious file is place inside the processed ZIP file. During the exploitation, it's common that `#` would be encoded with its URL Encoded value `%23`.
