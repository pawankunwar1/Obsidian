Cloud Computing Services
1) SaaS(Software as a Service) -> ex- gmail, google drive -> 
2) PaaS(Platform as a Service) -> ex- if we have python application , if we want to host it we just upload code and all the things are done by platform.

Amazon EC2 ->
-> The virtual computing servers are known as `Instances` in EC2.
-> An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a template that contains a software configuration (for example, an operating system , an application server, and applications ). From an AMI, we launch an instance, which is a copy of the AMI running as a virtual server in the cloud. ex- we can copy one host into ten host with doing more much.
-> When we launch an instance , the instance type that we specify determines the hardware of the host computer used for your instance. Each instance type offers different compute, memory, and storage capabilities, and grounded in an instance family based on these capabilities.
-> Types of storage used in  EC2 -> a) Amazon EFS b) Instance Store c) Amazon EBS d)Amazon S3
