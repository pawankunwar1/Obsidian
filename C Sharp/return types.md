The `CreatedAtAction()` method takes three arguments:

- The name of the action method that created the item. In this case, the action method is called `GetItem()`, so the first argument is `nameof(GetItem)`.
- An object that contains the route values for the action method. In this case, the only route value is the `id` of the item, so the second argument is `new {id = item.Id}`.
- The item that was created. In this case, the item is the `item` object that was returned from the `GetItem()` method, so the third argument is `item.AsDto()`.

The `CreatedAtAction()` method will then return a response with the status code 201 (Created) and the item in the body of the response.
