-> `CreateBuilder()` method in ASP.NET is a factory method that creates a new instance of the `WebApplicationBuilder` class with preconfigured defaults. The `WebApplicationBuilder` class is responsible for configuring and building a new ASP.NET Core web application.
-> Once you have created a `WebApplicationBuilder` object, you can use it to configure your ASP.NET Core web application. For example, you can use the `Services` property to add services to your application, and the `Configuration` property to access configuration settings.
-> Once you have finished configuring your application, you can build it by calling the `Build()` method on the `WebApplicationBuilder` object. This will create a new `WebApplication` object, which you can then use to start your application.
