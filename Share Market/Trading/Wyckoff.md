Four Phases of Price Action
-> Accumulation
-> Uptrend
-> Distribution
-> Downtrend


Three Types of Scenarios
-> Uptrend 
-> Downtrend
-> Sideways

Sideways can be of five types ->
1) Accumulation
2) Re-Accumulation
3) Distribution
4) Re-distribution
5) Random Range

Law of Cause and Effect
-> Cause relates to the accumulation/distribution and Effect relates to the uptrend/downtrend phase.
-> The effect is proportional to is causes. -> meaning `long accumulation -> long uptrend` and `short accumulation -> short uptrend` and -> `long distribution -> long downtrend` and` short distribution -> short downtrend `
-> We can also confirm accumulation and distribution 
a) Trendline Break
b) Multiple TImeframe -> means look for 4 hr or other hr chart

-> we draw trendline after 3 dip meaning for accumulation we draw after when `certain candle go low -> 1 dip then other candle go up -> 2 dip if candle go low than first candle and 3 dip if candle go low after 2 dip`


-> Law of Cause and Effect does not work always
-> SO we use Fast Reversal Patterns
1) Climax
2) Double Top / Bottom
3) Pullback
4) Bull / Bear Trap


Law of Effort and Result
-> Effort means Volume and Result means Price

-> When price actions reflects the volume action, there is harmony
-> When price actions does not reflect the volume action , there is divergence

->High Volume && Wide Range Candle -> Harmony
-> Low Volume && Narrow Range Candle -> Harmony
-> Low Volume && Wide Range Candle -> Divergence
-> High Volume && Narrow Range Candle -> Divergence

Case 1-> if the price increases with volume then it showed -> buyers wanted to buy the stock -> means it is strong up trend. -> buy in this case
Case 2 -> If the price increase but volume decreases then it showed -> sellers wanted to sell the stock or it is not strong trend -> we should avoid this
Case 3 -> if the price decreases but volume increase means -> players still sell the stock 
Case 4 -> if the price decreases and volume decrease -> now it has come to below now it is low priced -> buy in this case
